## Mortgage Calculator
Project for CSC 221 - Software Design Lab at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- A JavaFx mortgage calculator app that allows the users to enter a purchase price, down-payment amount and interest rate.
- Based on these values, the app should calculate the loan amount (purchase price minus down payment) and display the monthly payment for 10-,20- and 30- year loans.
- Allow the user to select a custom loan duration (in years) by using slider and display the monthly payments.
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
